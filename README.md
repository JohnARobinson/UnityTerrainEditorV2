Tile Based Unity Terrain Editor(Obsolete)

Base code for Unity based game idea's initial feature development of modular tile terrain system. Running into difficulties with shader code when it comes to merging textures between tiles.

Difficulties choosing between large mesh with submeshes or indivdual meshes for each tile. This project used many individual meshes each with its own texture. Issues with implementing texture blending system between each tile.

Abandoned this project so far as was mesh generation system did not work with dynamic mesh texture merging. Related game idea's are preserved just code progress thus far on this project scrapped

Included functions so far <br>
-dynamic mesh tile terrain system with interface to change y value <br>
-dynamic mesh tile texture system: in progress difficulties with including large number of meshes that can all pull from a large pool of textures. In progress texture blending between tiles<br>
-in progress cliff system<br>
